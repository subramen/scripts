# spotify-playlist-mp3
Retrieves tracks in a playlist and rips the mp3 from youtube

Requires: youtube_dl,
          Spotify account

Spotify provides playlist data in a JSON response. To GET it, an OAuth token is required. Currently it isn't implemented. I am generating a token in their API Console - https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-playlist/ 

The script uses the JSON file obtained from the console. This is a purely academic venture.
